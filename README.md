Workday Agile Boards

The intent of this web application is to showcase the capabilities of Workday Projects in conjunction with Workday Cloud Platform.

In this use case for Kanban and Scrum Boards, Workday Project data is manipulated to represent these data structures. REST APIs update the underlying Workday data in real-time.

Benefits:
- Control of system of record
- Powerful Reporting Capabilities
- Downstream availability for processing (time & expenses)
- Ease of use for project members
